<h2>Mod Share Terms of Use</h2>
<p>Mod Share is a community driven site. Because of that, <em>you</em> are ultimately responsible for keeping it safe. So, please follow the following rules:</p>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Keep everything appropriate</b> - This is a site for all ages, so all content submitted must be appropriate for those ages</li>
		<li><b>Be respectful</b> - Pretty self-explanatory. Respect other people, their actions, and their opinions, even if you disagree.</li>
		<li><b>Give credit when remixing or copying stuff</b> - Don&apos;t take someone else&apos;s work and claim it as your own. Always give credit to creators of content used in a project somewhere in it (e.g. the project description, the project intro screen, etc.)</li>
		<li><b>Be constructive</b> - Everything done here must have a legitimate purpose. All comments need to be on-topic and related to the topic at hand. Do not post links to your projects on other people&apos;s projects or on the forums unless it is somehow related.</li>
		<li><b>Be honest</b> - Pretty simple. Always speak truthfully.</li>
		<li><b>Flag/report anything that doesn&apos;t follow the above rules</b> - We want to be able to keep the site entirely clean, and we need the users to help us out. If you see anything that violates these rules, please let us know by reporting/flagging it or <a href="/help">contacting us</a>.</li>
	</ul>
